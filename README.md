# 🧠 Ragna – Smart Query Bot

Ragna is a smart query bot that answers questions using prompt engineering and RAG.  
It fetches relevant info from a custom knowledge base and formats responses clearly.  
With function calling, it handles tasks like showing weather, workouts, or piano notes.  
I built it to make information access fast, flexible, and easy to use.
